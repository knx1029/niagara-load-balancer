2. Niagara Experiment

use exNgFull.sh

# set up routing on s1 and s2
# run on controller
./exNgFull.sh rt

# install niagara rules on hswitch
# run on controller
./exNgFull.sh ng

# set up NAT on sswitch1 and sswitch2
# run on both hosts' xterms
./exNgFull.sh sswitch1
./exNgFull.sh sswitch2

# start server on server1 and server2
# run on both hosts' xterms
./exNgFull.sh sv

# wget website
# run the command on either client to verify the redirection
./exNgFull.sh wget


# clear up set up
# run on controller
./exNgFull.sh rm rt
./exNgFull.sh rm ng
# run on hosts' xterm
./exNgFull.sh sswitch1
./exNgFull.sh sswitch2
